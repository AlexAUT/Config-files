## Prerequisite
* sway or i3
* [swayblocks](https://github.com/rei2hu/swayblocks)
* j4-dmenu-desktop
* termite (preferable without window decorations)
* acpi (battery indicator)
* playerctl (for media control)
* brightnessctl (changing screen brightness, **current user has to be in input and screen group**)
* amixer (volume control, alsa-utils)
* pactl (should be included by pulse-audio)
* wget
* unzip
* ttf-liberation
* adobe-source-code-pro
* swaylock-fancy
### sway specific
* grim (screenshot)
* slurp (select area for screenshot)
* jq (json parsing for printing a specific screen)
### i3 specific
* feh (setting background)

## Modify config
The final `i3.config` and `sway.config` are generated by the setup script. They are build from the `desktop.config` and `sway.*.config` or `i3.*.config` files so only modify these files and then rerun the `setup.sh`

### sway
It is recommended to adjust `sway.display.config` to your specific display setup

## Install
* run setup.sh
* Restart your desktop enviroment (recommended) or realod the config (default $mod+Shift+c)

## Shortcuts
Volume, brightness and media keys should work out of the box.

### Sway screenshot
When using sway there are three shortcuts:
1) **Print** prints the whole display setup
2) **Alt+Print** prints the current selected display
3) **Shift+Print** select area to print

Screenshots are stored inside the clipboard by default, press $mod additionally to store them into your XDG_Pictures folder.

### i3 screenshot
just use gnome-screenshot :)
